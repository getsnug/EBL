# EBL
Hello, this codebase is for the purpose of being able to perform Electron Beam Lithography(EBL) an a ThermoFisher desktop SEM, using the pyPhenom ppi interface. Given that most universities have access to an SEM it seems limiting that the programs to perform EBL are not widely available. My goal with this project is to make EBL accessible to anyone with access to an SEM. I'm not super sure who initially wrote the code at ThermoFisher but a huge thanks to them for setting this up. Also, for the duration of this project I will be using this document as a way to keep track of troubleshooting our procedure.
